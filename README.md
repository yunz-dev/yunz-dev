# 👋 Hi there, I'm Yunus!

🎓 *Computer Science Student*
💻 **Systems & Backend Engineering** | Distributed Systems | Open Source

I specialise in building high-performance infrastructure, real-time telemetry systems, and scalable backend services. I love diving deep into low-level concurrency (Rust/Go) just as much as architecting microservices (Java/Python). <br>

### 🚀 Currently Working on

- **Redis but Brown** 
  - *Systems Engineering* | Rust, Tokio, TCP
  - Building a multi-threaded, Redis-compatible in-memory key-value store from scratch.
  - Implementing the **RESP protocol** and utilising `Arc<RwLock>` for safe concurrent state management.

- **PriceByte** *(In Progress)*
  - *Backend Engineering* | Java Spring Boot, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker
  - Scalable grocery aggregator with a hybrid scraping/API pipeline handling **50k+ product entries**.
  - Features strict ACID compliance and Redis caching to reduce API latency by **40%**.
